# C-WinRT-Console-Application

This project was made for a tutorial on how to use WinRT in C++. I used the code that was provided in the tutroial in a Visual Studio application. The level of skill that I would say that I am at would be gaining a higher grasp and understanding of how C++ works. This was created as an assigment for COP 3003. The course was adminstered at Florida Gulf Coast University.
